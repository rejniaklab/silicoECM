Project Title silicoECM: a mathematical model of tumor cell-ECM interactions

Description: This code simulates the development of tumor-associated collagen signatures (TACS) during the growth of a tumor cell cluster. TACS are distinct patterns of ECM fibril arrangement due to tumor cells pushing or pulling on the fibrils. The code is generated in Matlab.

Dependencies: the R2022a version of Matlab on a Mac computer was used for all testing

Installing: this code does not need installation

Executing the program: download a MATLAB file TACS_patterns.m and run 

File manifest The following function is available:TACS_patterns.m
